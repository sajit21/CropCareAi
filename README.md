# CropCareAi
A final year project on Plant Disease Detection Sytem. 
- collected the dataset from kaggle and other resources
- Extra algorithm such as GrabCut for Image segmentation before feeding CNN model
- Binary classification Algorithm to identify whether the uploaded image is Leaf or Not
- Custom CNN Model of Deep Learning to identify the disease available in Plants
- Python script for the interaction with the trained model

- In this project, I worked on the UI/Ux design and  Backend development for the web interface with my other two friends
  Prajwol Shrestha- Worked on Frontend Interface and APi Integration
 and Rizan Shrestha- The main guy who build model and helped us understand how they are trained and Algorithm are implemented.
